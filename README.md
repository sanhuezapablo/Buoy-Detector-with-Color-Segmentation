# Buoy-Detection-using-Color-Segmentation

## **PROJECT DESCRIPTION**

The aim of this project is to perform Buoy Detection with the concept of color segmentation using Gaussian Mixture Models and Expectation Maximization techniques.

Since the video is shot underwater, conventional segmentation techniques involving color thresholding will not work well in such an environment, since noise and varying light intensities will render any hard-coded thresholds ineffective.

In such a scenario, we “learn” the color distributions of the buoys and use that learned model to segment them. We obtain a tight segmentation of each buoy for the entire video sequence by applying a tight contour (in the respective color of the buoy being segmented) around each buoy.

Please refer to [Project Report](https://github.com/sanhuezapablo/Buoy-Detection-using-Color-Segmentation/blob/master/Report/Final%20Report.pdf) for further description

### Preparing the Input

</p>

- First, I have cropped out samples of the buoy and saved them for further training

#### Visualizing Histograms

</p>

- Then, for each buoy, I have computed and visualized the average color histogram for each channel of the sampled RGB images to get an idea of the output

#### 1D Gaussians

- Finally, I have designed and implemented a process to segment the buoys using a 1-D Gaussian to get a better idea of the output

We see this method gives us bad results, however it does detect the buoys, we thus use this method as a stepping stone for our next step where we would train multiple gaussians onto the data.

### Expectation Maximization from Scratch

</p>

- I have generated data samples from three 1-D Gaussians, with different means and variances.
- Next, the Expectation Maximization algorithm was Implemented
- Finally,the model parameters for the three Gaussians (i.e. the means and variances) are reecovered

### Learning Color Models

Now we extend the previous concepts and implementations of **1D gaussians** and **EM technique** to achieve the original goal of segmenting the buoys

#### 1D EM Implementation for Color Analysis

#### 3D EM Implementation Color Analysis

- For each color, I have already computed and visualized the color histogram for each channel of the sampled/cropped images
gathered during the data preparation phase. This will provide some intuition on the number of Gaussians [N] required to fit to the color histogram. I have also tried to determine the dimension [D] of each Gaussian for the model
- Then I use the previously implemented EM algorithm to compute the model parameters, i.e. the means and
variances of the N D-dimensional Gaussian.
